      "Yes. It's you Leia.\n",
      "You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.\n",

      "When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?\n",
      "This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?\n",
      "We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?\n",
      "Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.\n",
      "Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?\n",
      "That's where my father was killed.\n",
      "Don't you have a Kiber crystal?\n",
      "How can you store an energy field within you?\n",
      "But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",
      "Could I learn to feel it?\n",
      "You mean I generate an energy field?\n",
      "My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...\n",
      "But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!\n",
      "But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.\n",
      "My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.\n",
      "I assure you my intentions weren't bad.\n",
      "You saw through me?\n",
      "I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.\n",
      "But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...\n",
      "I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.\n",
      "You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?\n",
      "Who are you anyway?\n",
      "Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.\n",
      "I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.\n",
      "Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!\n",
      "What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?\n",
      "At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.\n",
      "But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?\n",
      "But there was a lot of firing earlier...\n",
      "You look great!  The uniform and everything!\n",
      "Yes, sir, but I can get him...\n",
      "I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.\n",
      "I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.\n",
      "Yes, sir.\n",
      "Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.\n",
      "Yes, sir.\n",
      "Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.\n",
      "You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...\n",
      "They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.\n",
      "Come back here... Where are you going?\n",
      "It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!\n",
      "Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.\n",
      "Is he afraid of the water?\n",
      "I think she's going to be all right.\n",
      "See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...\n",
      "Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...\n",
      "Why didn't you say so before.\n",
      "Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.\n",
      "I don't know... I've never fought anyone.\n",
      "Well, I practice a lot...\n",
      "Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.\n",
      "Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.\n",
      "You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...\n",
      "What are you saying?\n",
      "You don't believe in the Force?\n",
      "Who's the pilot?\n",
      "We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.\n",
      "That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.\n",
      "The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.\n",
      "No need, everything's under control.\n",
      "A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...\n",
      "I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.\n",
      "Are there medical facilities on Yavin?\n",
      "I am Luke Starkiller at your service.\n",
      "You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.\n",
      "You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...\n",
      "But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!\n",
      "I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.\n",
      "I'd consider it an honor.\n",
      "Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...\n",
      "Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...\n",
      "See Threepio!  Do you copy?\n",
      "Good.  We're right above you.  Stand by.\n",
      "Are you safe?\n",
      "You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?\n",
      "See Threepio... do you copy?\n",
      "Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.\n",
      "Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.\n",
      "Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.\n",
      "I think we're going to need them. Blast it!\n",
      "No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...\n",
      "Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.\n",
      "Well, I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.\n",
      "According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...\n",
      "Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?\n",
      "You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?\n",
      "There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...\n",
      "That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.\n",
      "Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.\n"
